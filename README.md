# NiV-ORF-Intelligence-Toolkit
Automated ORF detection, protein translation, and genome quality assessment pipeline applied to Nipah virus genome.

This project provides an automated pipeline for detecting, translating, and evaluating open reading frames (ORFs) in viral and clinical DNA/RNA sequences.

It is designed to assist researchers in rapid genome assessment prior to downstream analysis such as protein modelling or drug discovery.
